# codemeetup-forum

## Objective of the project
The goal is to set up the code for a generic online **[Internet Forum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum)** which can be taylored to needs for various purposes. 

## The goal underneath
This is a place where developers can learn the ropes of software collaboration and how to go about github projects. Our very experienced and super patient host Niclas is guiding us all the way.

### Approach
We work in 2 groups towards our common goal: One team is responsible for the **backend** functionalities the other is providing the code needed on the **frontend** side.  


### Weekly Meetups and Proceeding
We meet once a week to discuss what needs to be done. We start out as a joined group and then usually we split up into the **frontend** and the **backend** teams.   

***New members are welcome to join either group!***
